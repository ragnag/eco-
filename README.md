# eco++

Eco+++ is a system to model the energy consumption of a house located on the island. 

The house has a solar panel and a wind turbine. The energy produced by the latter depends irreparably on the climate. Indeed when it rains there is a lot of wind so the wind turbine provides a lot of energy in return there is less solar radiance so the photovoltaic panels will provide less electricity. In the same way, during the summer it very often happens that there is a lot of sun but little wind. 

The objective is therefore to make a compromise between the electrical energy consumption of the house and the energy that can be provided by the photovoltaic panel and the wind turbine. 

The house is a normal house and includes several facilities. So we have a house class that includes several other classes:

The lamps
The TVs
The radiators

# eco++

Eco+++ is a system to model the energy consumption of a house located on the island. 
The house has a solar panel and a wind turbine. The energy produced by the latter depends irreparably on the climate. Indeed when it rains there is a lot of wind so the wind turbine provides a lot of energy in return there is less solar radiance so the photovoltaic panels will provide less electricity. In the same way
